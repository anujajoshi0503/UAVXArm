### Loading Firmware ###

Your board will come with the appropriate firmware loaded. To load new firmware you use the STM Flash Loader in the distribution package.

The following sequence of screen shots is self explanatory.

Use UAVXGUI to put the board in bootloader mode or connect the boot pins before powering up the board.

Set the baud rate to 115K and the COM port as necessary.

Select the STM32F4-1024K.

Wait until the verify is complete. Remove power and then remove the Boot0 link. Verify that the new firmware responds using UAVPSet.
