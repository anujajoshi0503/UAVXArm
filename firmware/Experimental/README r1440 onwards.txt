From r1440 onwards support for parallel receiver input has been retired in the interest of greatly simplifying the code. 

The Telemetry port can be used directly without switching it to the GPS when arming. This means the GPS runs from power up reducing the acquisition time. 

CPPM recievers are connected to the first RC pin and the GPS to the 3rd (Tx to GPS) and 4th (Rx from GPS) RC pins.
